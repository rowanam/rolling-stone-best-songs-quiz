## Creation Process - UXD

### Strategy

The goal of this project is to create a quiz game that generates interesting questions for a user and is highly interactive.

The user will likely be someone who is interested in and knowledgeable about music and wants to test their knowledge about popular music; someone who isn't as knowledgeable but wants to enjoy a short quiz; or someone who wants to learn more about popular music.

### Scope

This is a one-page website with one main feature, the quiz game.

The quiz has these main features: 
- three different difficulty levels
- generates random questions based on which categories are included in the selected difficulty level
- feedback on whether the user was correct or incorrect
- information about the correct answer
- control buttons to select answers and control the progression of the game

### Structure

The site has a simple structure, with a header and footer to provide basic site information and form, and the quiz as the page content.

The structure of the quiz game content will change, with elements being displayed and hidden at relevant points during the game.

### Skeleton

The developer created sketches of each stage of the quiz on paper.

The landing page has game background and instructions followed by game mode selection options.

When the quiz is active, the game mode buttons are displayed at the top of the screen. Underneath, the game displays the user's progression through the quiz (the number of questions answered). The quiz displays a question with four answer options, followed by a submit button that changes to a next question button when a guess is submitted. When the user guesses, information about the correct answer is displayed at the bottom.

After the quiz is finished, the result is displayed along with a button to play again.

### Surface

The site uses three fonts (all selected from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)):
- [Lobster](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster) - main headings and certain accent elements
- [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald) - quiz question topics and answers
- [Poiret One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poiret+One) - all other page text

Lobster and Poiret One were chosen as Rolling Stone magazine was at the height of its popularity in the 70's - 90's, and these decades are the most represented in the list - for this reason, the site uses design themes from this time period, including these two fonts. Oswald was chosen to complement these fonts but provide better readability, allowing the user to quickly figure out what the question is asking about and read the answer options.

Vinyl record images are used a few times on the site to emphasize the music theme. A vinyl background image provides color and texture to make the site more appealing. The answer option buttons are vinyl icons, an image which is also repeated in the favicon, to provide interactivity by spinning when hovered over or clicked.

The main theme colors are red and yellow, aligning with colors popular in the theme decades. The shade of red chosen (#ee1d25) was taken from the Rolling Stone magazine logo, for consistency.
